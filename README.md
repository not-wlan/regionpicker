# CS:GO Regionpicker
CS:GO Regionpicker allows you to select the regions you want to play in!

# Usage
1. Inject regionpicker.dll into CS:GO
2. Start the queue for any online mode
3. The queue will automatically stop once the datacenters have been initialized
4. You can now use ALT + 1, ALT + 2, ALT + 3 and ALT + 4 to switch between modes.

- ALT + 1 will only connect you to servers that you have 150ms+ ping to
- ALT + 2 will equalize all ping values
- ALT + 3 will only connect you to japanese servers
- ALT + 4 will reset the settings

RegionPicker will beep shortly and print the selected mode to the ingame console when it's changed.

I've left various TODOs in the code. Additionally a more user-friendly UI would be neat.
